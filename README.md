# Deep-Learning-based-sentiment-analysis
Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks
****

In this project, an LSTM based network is developed to classify the app store reviews of the Canvas Student App to be of Positive or Negative Sentiment. The trained model is evaluated against alternative settings including another neural network and a Random forest model. The aim of this work is to evaluate the efficiency of Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis.

A final report on the project can be accessed here: [Deep Learning Based Sentimaent Analysis.pdf](https://github.com/Onikenny/Deep-Learning-based-sentiment-analysis/blob/main/Deep%20Learning%20based%20Sentiment%20Analysis.pdf)

### Data:  Android and IOS applications users’ reviews for the Canvas app on Google play store and Apple IOS store were obtained using a third-party app “Appfollow” and 
annotated using the Vader module. The data comprises of three datasets (availabel in this repo) merged for the analysis.

### Packages used(See Notebook for full list:
    -Python.3.10 
    -Pandas Python Data Analysis Library. V.1.3.4 for data cleaning and pre-processing. Also, to generate Statistical profiling of data.
    -Numpy for Data transformation
    -Sklearn for predictive analysis and model evaluation
    -Keras and Tensorflow for Predictive modelling
    -Seaborn 0.11.2, Matplotlib for data visualization
